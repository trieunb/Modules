# Modules

This package gives you the ability to use Laravel 5 with module system.
You can simply drop or generate modules with their own controllers, models, views and a routes file into the `app/Modules` folder and go on working with them.

<!-- Thanks to zyhn for the ["Modular Structure in Laravel 5" tutorial](https://github.com/trieunb/Modules). Well explained and helped a lot. -->

## Installation

The best way to install this package is through your terminal via Composer.

Run the following command from your projects root
```
composer require "trieunb/modules @dev"
```
Once this operation is complete, simply add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` and you're done.

#### Service Provider
```
Trieunb\Modules\ModuleServiceProvider::class,
```

## Getting started

The built in Artisan command `php artisan make:module name` generates a ready to use module in the `app/Modules` folder and a migration if necessary.

<!-- Since version 1.3.0 you can generate modules named with more than one word, like `demo`. -->

This is how the generated module would look like:
```
laravel-project/
    app/
    └── Modules/
        └── Demo/
            ├── Controllers/
            │   └── DemoController.php
            ├── Models/
            │   └── Demo.php
            ├── Views/
            │   └── index.blade.php
            └── routes.php
                
```

## Usage

The generated `RESTful Resource Controller` and the corresponding `routes.php` make it easy to dive in. In my example you would see the output from the `Modules/Demo/Views/index.blade.php` when you open `laravel-project:8000/demo` in your browser.
